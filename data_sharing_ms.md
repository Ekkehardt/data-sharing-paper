Ten simple ways to make it easier to re(use) your data
======================================================

1. Make individual files as easy to understand and work with as possible
2. Make it as easy as possible to combine your data with other datasets
3. Make it easy to find and use your data

Introduction
------------

* In recent years there has been an increasing emphasis on sharing the
  data used in publications through places like Dryad, Ecological
  Archives, Figshare, etc.
* This is good because it allows reuse, replication, etc.
* However, while sharing data is increasingly straightforward, much
  shared data is not easily reused and therefore is less beneficial
  than it could be
* Here we provide a list of 10 simple ways to make it easier to reuse
  the data that you share, thus maximizing the benefits of sharing
  that data.
* These recommendations don't only make it easier for others to use
  your data, but also for you to use your own data.

1. Share your data
------------------

The most important thing is that you share your data at all, and this
is why...
* Increased attention/citation [Piwowar et al. 2007] (http://www.plosone.org/article/info:doi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0000308)
* Increased collaborations
* Increasingly required for [funding] (http://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/dmp.jsp) and publication
* [May become required by law (e.g. FASTR)] (http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/FASTR_calltoaction.shtml)

2. Provide metadata
-------------------

The first key to using data is understanding what it is. Metadata is
information about the data that helps users understand the data. This
can take several forms:

* Descriptive names in the data files themselves
* Written description
* Machine readable
* Images such as maps of data collection


3. Perform basic quality control
--------------------------------


4. Use standard formats that will work across systems
------------------------------------------------------

* csv
* no spaces
* no special characters
* etc.

5. Use standard data structures
-------------------------------

* There are lots of different kinds of data and they should conform to standards
* The most common form of data in ecology and evolution is tabular data
* Should follow: one type of information per column, one data point-
  standard database structure rules
* Note: Should we comment on image or audio file formats?


6. Provide a raw form of the data
---------------------------------

* Your fancy model/correction might be best for your purposes, but it
can make it difficult to combine your data with other studies.
* How should very large data files be compressed?
	* .zip
	* .tar.gz


7. Use good null values
-----------------------

If we can figure out what these are. To be honest all I've found so
far is a surprising lack of consistency and well reasoned discussion.


8. Make it easy to combine your data with other datasets
--------------------------------------------------------

* Linking tables for things like
    * Taxonomy
	* Location
* Clearly defined spatial and temporal extents of the study

9. Use an established and liberal license 
-----------------------------------------

* [About creative commons licenses] (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/)


10. Use a established repository
-------------------------------

* Long-term preservation
* Visibility
* Searchability
* Etc.
* Do we need to include a list of repos here?
